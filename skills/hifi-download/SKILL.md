# MusicMaster

Music discovery (Spotify, Last.fm) and Hi-Res audio downloads (Qobuz, TIDAL) through a unified CLI.

All commands use `bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh <script> [args...]`, which activates the venv and runs the corresponding Python script. Output is human-readable by default; use `--json` where supported for structured output.

## First-Time Setup

### Step 1: Check Dependencies

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/setup.sh check
```

Output is key=value pairs. If `VENV=missing`, run install first.

### Step 2: Install

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/setup.sh install [--with-qobuz] [--with-tidal]
```

Creates `.venv`, installs core dependencies (`spotipy`, `pylast`, `requests`, `python-dotenv`), and optionally installs download backends.

### Step 3: Configure Credentials

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT ask the user for credentials in chat. Instead:
1. Create `.env` from template if not exists: `cp ${SKILL_PATH}/.env.example ${SKILL_PATH}/.env`
2. Tell user to edit `${SKILL_PATH}/.env` with their credentials
3. Wait for confirmation, then verify

Alternatively, use the config script:

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh setup_config --lastfm-key=KEY [--spotify-id=ID --spotify-secret=SECRET] [--qobuz-email=EMAIL --qobuz-password=PASS]
```

**Where to get credentials:**
- Spotify: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard (free)
- Last.fm: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create (free)
- Qobuz: Requires Studio/Sublime subscription
- TIDAL: Run `tiddl auth login` in venv for OAuth

### Step 4: Verify

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh status
```

Shows which services are **READY**, **DISABLED**, or **need setup**. **Only use services marked READY.**

## Service Types

| Type | Services | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Discovery | Spotify, Last.fm | Search, recommendations, similar artists |
| Downloads | Qobuz, TIDAL | High-quality audio (FLAC, Hi-Res) |

## Discovery Commands

### Last.fm — Similar Artists

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh lastfm_artists "Radiohead"
```

Returns a list of similar artists with match scores.

### Last.fm — Similar Tracks

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh lastfm_tracks "Karma Police" "Radiohead"
```

Arguments: track name, then artist name.

### Last.fm — Taste Profile

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh lastfm_taste
```

Returns the user's top artists and tracks from listening history.

### Spotify — Search

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh spotify_search "OK Computer"
```

Searches Spotify catalog for tracks, albums, and artists.

### Spotify — User Library

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh spotify_user tracks|artists
```

Gets the user's saved tracks or followed artists (requires OAuth).

### Spotify — Track/Album Info

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh spotify_info SPOTIFY_URI_OR_ID
```

## Download Commands

### Search Platform Catalog

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh platform_search "Album Name" -p qobuz|tidal
```

Searches the download platform's catalog. Returns IDs for use with download command.

### Download

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh platform_download ID -p qobuz|tidal -t album|track
```

Downloads audio in the configured quality. Use the ID from `platform_search` results.

## Service Management

### Disable a Service

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh disable_service spotify --reason "No account"
```

### Enable a Service

```bash
bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh enable_service spotify
```

## Workflow — Music Discovery

1. Run `status` to check available services
2. Use `lastfm_artists` or `lastfm_tracks` to find similar music
3. Use `spotify_search` to look up specific tracks/albums
4. Present results to user in a clear table format
5. If user wants to download, use `platform_search` → `platform_download`

## Workflow — Download Hi-Res Audio

1. Run `status` to confirm download service is READY
2. Search: `platform_search "Album Name" -p qobuz`
3. Present results with quality info
4. Download: `platform_download ID -p qobuz -t album`
5. Report download path and file size to user

## Error Handling

| Error | Detection | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Venv missing | `run.sh` exits with `venv_missing` | Run `bash ${SKILL_PATH}/scripts/setup.sh install` |
| Service not configured | `status` shows `NOT CONFIGURED` | Guide user to edit `.env` or run `setup_config` |
| Spotify OAuth expired | Spotify commands fail with auth error | Run `bash ${SKILL_PATH}/run.sh spotify_auth` to re-authorize |
| TIDAL token expired | `status` shows `ERROR` for TIDAL | Run `tiddl auth refresh` or `tiddl auth login` in venv |
| Service disabled by user | `status` shows `DISABLED` | Run `enable_service` if user wants to re-enable |
| No results | Search returns empty | Try different keywords or check service availability |

## Important Notes

- Spotify requires OAuth browser flow on first use (`spotify_auth` script handles this)
- TIDAL auth is managed by `tiddl` CLI tool, not stored in `.env`
- Qobuz credentials are stored in `.env` (sensitive — ensure file is in `.gitignore`)
- Download paths default to `~/Music/Qobuz` and `~/Music/TIDAL`
- Quality settings: Qobuz 27=Hi-Res 24-bit (highest), TIDAL HiFi=lossless
